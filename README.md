# Apna-Restaurant-Website
This is my first complete project/website with a custom backend using NodeJS .
I used ExpressJS for routing , Handlebars as a Template Engine and MongoDB as a Backend.
In this project I focused on solving the ordering and Booking services of any Restaurant/Food delivery hub. Using this project Users can directly interact with the Restaurant Faculty,can order their Food and Book thier table also . they can get the Restaurant insights by visiting this website .
