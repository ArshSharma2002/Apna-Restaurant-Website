                    Retail food delivery is a courier service in which a restaurant, store, or independent food delivery
                    company delivers food to a customer. . The delivered items can include entrees, sides, drinks,
                    desserts, or grocery items and are typically delivered in boxes or bags. The delivery person will
                    normally drive a car, but in bigger cities where homes and restaurants are closer together. A flat
                    rate delivery fee is often charged with what the customer has bought.

                    without an online booking system, you will have to rely on phone calls and walk-ins only to make
                    reservations. An online booking platform is а necessity. That’s why we would like to point out the

                    book a room anytime they want. In fact, studies show that a 24/7 online reservation system greatly
                    increases the number of hotel bookings.

                    First it discusses different forms of Indianizations in Chinese food served in India. One Major
                    observation was that Indian Chinese restaurants mostly use Indian spices, flavors, and materials to
                    make Chinese food, in which the main flavors are spicy, and pungent. The cooked food is served in a
                    bowl, and eaten with spoon, and fork. Predominant use of red color, random Chinese scripts, images
                    of Chinese temples, paintings or statues of Buddha.

        <h2 class="headings">Our story</h2>

            <p><span>We</span>
                went from a 36-seat restaurant to a 250+ seater. The popularity grew organically. Today, we boast a
                reputation of more than 60 years of experience in the catering and hospitality industry. Of course,
                during that time my dad was running the restaurant in Southall. My mom would help dad in his restaurant
                business. She is a supercook but my dad is the main chef.
            </p>
            <p>
                I think in the restaurant industry, it’s very important that you become a people’s person. You have to
                get that charisma, passion and show people that you are actually there to cater to their needs and
                giving them a great dining experience. Whosoever comes at Brilliant should say that they had a brilliant
                time at the restaurant.A strong family bond and togetherness have made us succeed. My father is the role
                model. I love his autocratic management style, and I see a lot of my father in me now. He is a very
                strong-minded person; he knows how to get the work done. And I am following his footsteps now. That’s
                most definitely one of the reasons why we are successful.
                Our restaurant is family run; it’s me, dad and my brother. Three of us run Brilliant in Southall and Dip
                in Brilliant in Fulham, London and it’s fantastic. We do have sometimes disagreement like in every
                family business and that’s how we make decisions.

                There are more advantages in a family-run business – firstly, they say teamwork is a dream work and for
                us it does. It’s a family affair and we are successful because of this fact. We don’t leave our
                restaurants for the managers to run. We run the restaurants ourselves. And for us, that is the sole
                reason why we are successful.
